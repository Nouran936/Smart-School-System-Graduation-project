# Smart-School-System-Graduation-project
Smart school integrated system
Our graduation project was developing a smart school system integrating multiple functionalities to enhance school safety and efficiency. The system contained the following features:


•	Violence detection implemented in real time to detect violent behavior

•	Automatic attendance based on face recognition to automate attendance taking

•	Liveness detection to prevent spoofing and ensure authentic face recognition

•	Uniform detection to verify school uniform compliance


We’ve used python programming language for developing the models on Kaggle notebooks, and for the deployment on a desktop application using pycharm IDE. We’ve also used also used libraries/ frameworks like TensorFlow, and OpenCV. Our UI was developed using QT designer with Pycharm IDE and the database was created on Microsoft SQL Server.
